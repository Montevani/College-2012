# College-2012
In these folders you're going to find a few of my assigments and projects for a C++ class (PCA, Programming for Control and Automation engineering) I took back in 2012.
I don't think I can share the questions/exercises so I'm only uploading the answers here.
There's an extremely slim chance they can be useful if you're taking a similar class so feel free to use them!
